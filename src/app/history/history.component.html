    <h1>Beer in the Ancient World</h1>
    <p>
      The intoxicant known in English as `beer' takes its name from the Latin
      `bibere' (by way of the German `bier') meaning `to drink' and the Spanish
      word for beer, cerveza' comes from the Latin word `cerevisia' for `of
      beer', giving some indication of the long span human beings have been
      enjoying the drink. Even so, beer brewing did not originate with the
      Romans but began thousands of years earlier. The Chinese brewed a type of
      beer but the product which became the most popular is credited to the
      Sumerians of Mesopotamia and most likely began over 10,000 years ago. The
      site known as Godin Tepe (in modern-day Iran) has provided evidence of
      beer brewing c. 3500 while sites excavated in Sumer suggest an even
      earlier date based on ceramics considered the remains of beer jugs and
      residue found in other ancient containers. Even so, the date of c. 4000
      BCE is usually given for the creation of beer. The craft of beer brewing
      traveled to Egypt through trade and the Egyptians improved upon the
      original process, creating a lighter product that enjoyed great
      popularity. Although beer was known afterwards to the Greeks and Romans,
      it never gained the same kind of following as those cultures preferred
      wine and thought of beer as a "barbarian" drink. One of the many peoples
      they regarded as "barbarians" - the Germans - perfected the art of brewing
      and created what is recognized today as beer.

    <h2>First Beer Brewing</h2>
    <p>
      First Beer Brewing The first beer in the world was brewed by the ancient
      Chinese around the year 7000 BCE (known as kui). In the west, however, the
      process now recognized as beer brewing began in Mesopotamia at the Godin
      Tepe settlement now in modern-day Iran between 3500 - 3100 BCE. Evidence
      of beer manufacture has been confirmed between these dates but it is
      probable that the brewing of beer in Sumer (southern Mesopotamia,
      modern-day Iraq) was in practice much earlier. Some evidence has been
      interpreted, however, which sets the date of beer brewing at Godin Tepe as
      early as 10,000 BCE when agriculture first developed in the region. While
      some scholars have contended that beer was discovered accidentally through
      grains used for bread-making which fermented, others claim that it
      preceded bread as a staple and that it was developed intentionally as an
      intoxicant. The scholar Max Nelson writes:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic">
      Fruits often naturally ferment through the actions of wild yeast and the
      resultant alcoholic mixtures are often sought out and enjoyed by animals.
      Pre-agricultural humans in various areas from the Neolithic Period on
      surely similarly sought out such fermenting fruits and probably even
      collected wild fruits in the hopes that they would have an interesting
      physical effect (that is, be intoxicating) if left in the open air. (9)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This theory of the intentional brewing of intoxicants, whether beer, wine,
      or other drink, is supported by the historical record which strongly
      suggests that human beings, after taking care of their immediate needs of
      food, shelter, and rudimentary laws, will then pursue the creation of some
      type of intoxicant. Although beer as it is recognized in the modern day
      was developed in Europe (specifically in Germany), the brew was first
      enjoyed in ancient Mesopotamia.
    </p>

    <h2>Beer in Mesopotamia</h2>
    <p>
      The people of ancient Mesopotamia enjoyed beer so much that it was a daily
      dietary staple. Paintings, poems, and myths depict both human beings and
      their gods enjoying beer which was consumed through a straw to filter out
      pieces of bread or herbs in the drink. The brew was thick, of the
      consistency of modern-day porridge, and the straw was invented by the
      Sumerians or the Babylonians, it is thought, specifically for the purpose
      of drinking beer. The famous poem Inanna and the God of Wisdom describes
      the two deities drinking beer together and the god of wisdom, Enki,
      becoming so drunk he gives away the sacred meh (laws of civilization) to
      Inanna (thought to symbolize the transfer of power from Eridu, the city of
      Enki, to Uruk, the city of Inanna). The Sumerian poem Hymn to Ninkasi is
      both a song of praise to the goddess of beer, Ninkasi, and a recipe for
      beer, first written down around 1800 BCE. In the Sumerian/Babylonian The
      Epic of Gilgamesh, the hero Enkidu becomes civilized through the
      ministrations of the temple harlot Shamhat who, among other things,
      teaches him to drink beer. Later in the story, the barmaid Siduri counsels
      Gilgamesh to give up his quest for the meaning of life and simply enjoy
      what it has to offer, including beer. he Sumerians had many different
      words for beer from sikaru to dida to ebir (which meant `beer mug') and
      regarded the drink as a gift from the gods to promote human happiness and
      well being. The original brewers were women, the priestesses of Ninkasi,
      and women brewed beer regularly in the home as part of their preparation
      of meals. Beer was made from bippar (twice-baked barley bread) which was
      then fermented and beer brewing was always associated with baking. The
      famous Alulu beer receipt from the city of Ur in 2050 BCE, however, shows
      that beer brewing had become commercialized by that time. The tablet
      acknowledges receipt of 5 Silas of `the best beer' from the brewer Alulu
      (five Silas being approximately four and a half litres). Under Babylonian
      rule, Mesopotamian beer production increased dramatically, became more
      commercialized, and laws were instituted concerning it as paragraphs
      108-110 of the Code of Hammurabi make clear:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic">
      108 If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept grain according to gross
      weight in payment of drink, but takes money, and the price of the drink is
      less than that of the grain, she shall be convicted and thrown into the
      water. <br />
      109 If conspirators meet in the house of a tavern-keeper, and these
      conspirators are not captured and delivered to the court, the
      tavern-keeper shall be put to death.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Law 108 had to do with those tavern keepers who poured `short measures' of
      beer in return for cash instead of grain (which could be weighed and held
      to a measure) to cheat their customers; they would be drowned if caught
      doing so. Beer was commonly used in barter, not for cash sale, and a daily
      ration of beer was provided for all citizens; the amount received depended
      on one's social status. The second law concerns tavern keepers encouraging
      treason by allowing malcontents to gather in their establishment and the
      third law cited concerns women who were consecrated to, or were
      priestesses of, a certain deity opening a common drinking house or
      drinking in an already established tavern. The Babylonians had nothing
      against a priestess drinking beer (as, with the Sumerians, beer was
      considered a gift from the gods) but objected to one doing so in the same
      way as common women would. The Babylonians brewed many different kinds of
      beer and classified them into twenty categories which recorded their
      various characteristics. Beer became a regular commodity in foreign trade,
      especially with Egypt, where it was very popular.
    </p>

    <h2>Beer in Ancient Egypt</h2>
    <p>
      The Egyptian goddess of beer was Tenenit (closely associated Meskhenet,
      goddess of childbirth and protector of the birthing house) whose name
      derives from tenemu, one of the Egyptian words for beer. The most popular
      beer in Egypt was Heqet (or Hecht) which was a honey-flavored brew and
      their word for beer in general was zytum. The workers at the Giza plateau
      received beer rations three times a day and beer was often used throughout
      Egypt as compensation for labor. The Egyptians believed that brewing was
      taught to human beings by the great god Osiris himself and in this, and
      other regards, they viewed beer in much the same way as the Mesopotamians
      did. As in Mesopotamia, women were the chief brewers at first and brewed
      in their homes, the beer initially had the same thick, porridge-like
      consistency, and was brewed in much the same way. Later, men took over the
      business of brewing and miniature carved figures found in the tomb of
      Meketre (Prime Minister to the pharaoh Mentuhotep II, 2050-2000 BCE) show
      an ancient brewery at work. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
      describing the diorama, "The overseer with a baton sits inside the door.
      In the brewery two women grind flour, which another man works into dough.
      After a second man treads the dough into mash in a tall vat, it is put
      into tall crocks to ferment. After fermentation, it is poured off into
      round jugs with black clay stoppers". Beer played an integral role in the
      very popular myth of the birth of the goddess Hathor. According to the
      tale (which forms part of the text of the Book of the Heavenly Cow - a
      version of the Great Flood myth which pre-dates the biblical tale of the
      Flood in the biblical book of Genesis) the god Ra, incensed at the evil
      and ingratitude of humanity who have rebelled against him, sends Hathor to
      earth to destroy his creation. Hathor sets to work and falls into an
      intense blood lust as she slaughters humanity, transforming herself into
      the goddess Sekhmet. Ra is at first pleased but then repents of his
      decision as Sekhmet's blood lust grows with the destruction of every town
      and city. He has a great quantity of beer dyed red and dropped at the city
      of Dendera where Sekhmet, thinking it is a huge pool of blood, stops her
      rampage to drink. She gets drunk, falls asleep, and wakes again as the
      goddess Hathor, the benevolent deity of, among other things, music,
      laughter, the sky and, especially, gratitude. The association between
      gratitude, Hathor and beer, is highlighted by an inscription from 2200 BCE
      found at Dendera, Hathor's cult center: "The mouth of a perfectly
      contented man is filled with beer." Beer was enjoyed so regularly among
      the Egyptians that Queen Cleopatra VII (c.69-30 BCE) lost popularity
      toward the end of her reign more for implementing a tax on beer (the first
      ever) than for her wars with Rome which the beer tax went to help pay for
      (although she claimed the tax was to deter public drunkeness). As beer was
      often prescribed for medicinal purposes (there were over 100 remedies
      using beer) the tax was considered unjust.
    </p>
    <h2>Beer in Ancient Greece and Rome</h2>
    <p>
      Beer brewing traveled from Egypt to Greece (as we know from the Greek word
      for beer, zythos from the Egyptian zytum) but did not find the same
      receptive climate there. The Greeks favored strong wine over beer, as did
      the Romans after them, and both cultures considered beer a low-class drink
      of barbarians. The Greek general and writer Xenophon, in Book IV of his
      Anabasis, writes:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic">
      There were stores within of wheat and barley and vegetables, and wine made
      from barley in great big bowls; the grains of barley malt lay floating in
      the beverage up to the lip of the vessel, and reeds lay in them, some
      longer, some shorter, without joints; when you were thirsty you must take
      one of these into your mouth, and suck. The beverage without admixture of
      water was very strong, and of a delicious flavour to certain palates, but
      the taste must be acquired. (26-27)
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Clearly, beer was not to Xenophon's taste; nor was it any more popular
      with his countrymen. The playwright Sophocles, among others, also refers
      to beer somewhat unfavorably and recommends moderation in its use. The
      Roman historian, Tacitus, writing of the Germans, says, "To drink, the
      Teutons have a horrible brew fermented from barley or wheat, a brew which
      has only a very far removed similarity to wine" and the Emperor Julian
      composed a poem claiming the scent of wine was of nectar while the smell
      of beer was that of a goat. Even so, the Romans were brewing beer
      (cerevisia) quite early as evidenced by the tomb of a beer brewer and
      merchant (a Cerveserius) in ancient Treveris (modern day Trier).
      Excavations of the Roman military encampment on the Danube, Castra Regina
      (modern day Regensburg) have unearthed evidence of beer brewing on a
      significant scale shortly after the community was built in 179 CE by
      Marcus Aurelius. Still, beer was not as popular as wine among the Celts
      and this attitude was encouraged by the Romans who had favored wine all
      along. The Celtic tribes paid enormous sums for wine provided by Italian
      merchants and the people of Gaul were famous for their love of Italian
      wines. Beer brewing continued to develop, however, in spite of the views
      of the elite that it was a low-class drink suitable only to barbarians and
      developed throughout Europe beginning in Germany.
    </p>
    <h2>Beer in Northern Europe</h2>
    <p>
      The Germans were brewing beer (which they called ol, for `ale') as early
      as 800 BCE as is known from great quantities of beer jugs, still
      containing evidence of the beer, in a tomb in the Village of Kasendorf in
      northern Bavaria, near Kulmbach. That the practice continued into the
      Christian era is evidenced by further archaeological finds and the written
      record. Early on, as it had been in Mesopotamia and Egypt, the craft of
      the brewer was the provenance of women and the Hausfrau brewed her beer in
      the home to supplement the daily meals. In time, however, the craft was
      taken over by Christian monks, primarily, and brewing became an integral
      part of the Monastic life. The Kulmbacher Monchshof Kloster, a monastery
      founded in 1349 CE in Kulmbach, still produces their famous Schwartzbier,
      among other brews, today. In 1516 CE the German Reinheitsgebot (purity
      law) was instituted which regulated the ingredients which could legally be
      used in brewing beer (only water, barley, hops and, later, yeast) and, in
      so doing, continued the practice of legislation concerning beer which the
      Babylonians under Hammurabi had done some three thousand years earlier.
      The Germans, like those who preceeded them, also instituted a daily beer
      ration and considered beer a necessary staple of their diet. From the
      Celtic lands (Germany through Britain, though which country brewed first
      is disputed) beer brewing spread, always following the same basic
      principles first instituted by the Sumerians: female brewers making beer
      in the home, use of fresh, hot water and fermented grains. The Finnish
      Saga of Kalewala (first written down in the 17th century CE from much
      older, pre-Christian, tales and consolidated in its present form in the
      19th century) sings of the creation of beer at length, devoting more lines
      to the creation of beer than the creation of the world. The female brewer,
      Osmata, trying to make a great beer for a wedding feast, discovers the use
      of hops in brewing with the help of a bee she sends to gather the magical
      plant. The poem expresses an admiration for the effects of beer which any
      modern-day drinker would recognize:
    </p>
    <blockquote class="italic">
      Great indeed the reputation Of the ancient beer of Kalew, Said to make the
      feeble hardy, Famed to dry the tears of women, Famed to cheer the
      broken-hearted, Make the aged young and supple, Make the timid brave and
      mighty, Make the brave men ever braver, Fill the heart with joy and
      gladness, Fill the mind with wisdom-sayings, Fill the tongue with ancient
      legends, Only makes the fool more foolish.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the Finnish saga, as in the writings of the ancient Sumerians, beer was
      considered a magical brew from the gods endowing the drinker with health,
      peace of mind and happiness. This idea was cleverly phrased by the poet
      A.E. Houseman when he wrote, "Malt does more than Milton can to justify
      God's ways to man" (a reference to the English poet John Milton and his
      `Paradise Lost'). From ancient Sumeria to the present day, Houseman's
      claim would go undisputed among those who have enjoyed the drink of the
      gods.
